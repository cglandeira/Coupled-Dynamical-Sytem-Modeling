<h1>Modeling a Zombie Apocalypse: A Coupled Dynamical System</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project presents a custom coupled dynamical system inspired by the SIR model for epidemic spread, adapted to simulate a zombie apocalypse. The model tracks four key populations: susceptible individuals, zombies, cured people, and the deceased. By defining difference and differential equations, the system is modeled in both discrete and continuous time. Additionally, randomness is introduced via stochastic simulation using a Gillespie algorithm. The project explores the impact of various initial conditions, model parameters, and steady-state analysis, offering insights into the potential outcomes of a zombie outbreak.
